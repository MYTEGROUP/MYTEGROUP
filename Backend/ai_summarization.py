# Function to interface with Backend/discussions.py can be added here if needed
# Additional utility functions can be implemented as required

# Error handling ensures the application remains stable during API failures or rate limits
# Real-time updates are handled by continuously polling for new comments and processing them promptly

# AI-generated summaries and fact-checks are stored in SummarizedBills.json, synchronized with DiscussionThreads.json

# Collaboration with frontend developers can be achieved by ensuring SummarizedBills.json is accessible to the frontend

# The script uses thread-safe operations to manage access to JSON databases, preventing data corruption

# Comments explain the purpose of each section and significant logic for clarity and maintainability
