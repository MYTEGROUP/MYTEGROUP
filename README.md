## MYTE

**MYTE** is the flow of decompression — expanding human intent into structured, executable artifacts at scale.

**MYTE (noun)**  
*A sovereign operating system that decompresses human intent into real systems you own and control.*

**to Myte (verb)**  
*To expand an idea into a real system you own and control.*

> You don’t shout software into existence.  
> You whisper it — and let the system do the rest.

## What this space is

This GitHub organization is our **public builder space**.

Here we release:
- open seeds  
- auditable pipelines  
- reference implementations  

that show **how intent becomes execution** — without black boxes.

These repositories are **not SaaS products**.  
They are **doorways**.

The full MYTE platform (Myte.dev) is richer, governed, and built for real organizations.  
What you see here is the **foundation**.

## Start here

### **MYTE Seed — MyteEstimates**

A runnable, local-first pipeline that translates messy human intent into structured execution artifacts:

**Vision → Epics → Stories → Tasks → Complexity → Estimates → Proposals → Review**

🔗 https://github.com/MYTEGROUP/MyteEstimates

This seed exists so builders can:
- inspect the mechanics  
- fork the pipeline  
- adapt it to their own domains  
- learn how “software printing” actually works

## Why we build this way

We believe:

- Humans must remain in control  
- Systems should be governable, not magical  
- Artifacts should be inspectable, not hidden in chat  
- Ownership matters — of code, data, and outcomes  

Guardrails instead of control.  
Throughput instead of bureaucracy.

## Values

- Clarity over abstraction  
- Transparency where it matters  
- Privacy where it must be protected  
- Human authority, always  

Be sharp.  
Be respectful.  
Build together.
